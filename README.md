# iffa.dev

From 20201 onwards, I have chosen to completely rewrite my personal site / portfolio / online resume / vault of random thoughts.

For several years now, I've preferred working with Angular (in fact that has been my main focus at [CGI](https://cgi.com)), but with the emergence of new tools and frameworks
for the web, I feel that it is now the time to branch out and deep-dive into something new and exciting!

This repository contains the source code to my personal site, currently being rebuilt with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). For a comprehensive overview on why Next.js was chosen, [Lee Robinson](https://github.com/leerob/)
has a great video on the topic, which you can find [here](https://youtu.be/rtgbaKBhdkk).

> TL;DR: Friendship ended with Angular, now React/Next.js is my best friend.

## Overview

Content coming soon, I promise.

### Built using

- **Next.js** as the framework
- **TypeScript**, because type-safety is awesome and should be standard
- **ESLint w/ Prettier**, it should make sense and look good
- **Commitlint**, just to make sure commit messages are not spaghetti 

## Running locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iffa/iffa.dev.git
cd iffa.dev
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see it in action.
